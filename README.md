# AUV
## Task 1

*ME20B2017*

*R Soorya Narayanan*

During the past week I was able to learn and use:
> - [x] git (I have the git installed in Ubuntu and use it alongside `VS code` software).
> - [x] github 
> - [x] markdown
> - [x] linux commands
> - [x] bash scripting

, primarily from the [materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PNTeKEmULQjl_d2O8RpaeMDXnFClQFlSvBnsUh3GAk/edit) provided from the MARS club, and for completing the [task 1](https://github.com/havok69/task1.git) of the MARS club, I had to use all these tools to complete the same.

Other works include:

> * Installation of Ubuntu 20.04 (required for AUV and also ok for use in MARS club).
> * Installation of ROS noetic framework (ROS melodic package was not available for 20.04 version).
